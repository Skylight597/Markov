//Markov model tasks:


// 1. identify the source file to read: user specified?  Dropped into a folder? Character limit?
// 2. Read the file
// 3. Get the size of the file based on the number of characters
// 4. Get user input seed size (a number 0-10)
// 5. Store the character seeds as specified by the seed size along with the following character.
// 6. Define the starting seed.
// 7. Take the seed string and review the stored data.  Calculate the probability of the next character based on the stored data.
// 8. Generate the next character.  Continue generating until the end of the original text is reached
// 9. Store the generated text and characters.
// 10. Return the generated text to the user.
// 11. Write unit tests
// 12. Handle errors.
